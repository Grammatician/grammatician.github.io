[{"content":"Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been programming in C++ and I am really happy with the language. Function signatures form their own grammar, and I rely heavily on this for calculation\nI rely heavely on reading funciton declarations. Having them in header files seperated from their definitions, makes C++ easier to read than C# where you have to wade through the definitions to read the signature.\nWithout static typing, languages like Python are totally incomprehensible to me.\n","date":"2021-05-07","permalink":"https://grammatician.github.io/post/programming/","tags":["Programming"],"title":"Programming"},{"content":"Every field has it\u0026rsquo;s own unique grammar. These grammars can be noun orientated or verb orientated. Verb orientated grammers are actionable, noun grammars are not, and it is interesting to think about why the Teleology demands a particular grammars orientation.\nClassical education taught Rhetorical Devices. These are set pieces that can be performed by a writer. However, modernity has all but abandoned this tradition. Linguists merely seek to describe, and language educaters have a distaste for the objective and wallow in the subjective.\nThe purpose of this blog is to develop a new grammar for language, finding a vocabulary that is verb orientated.\n","date":"2021-05-06","permalink":"https://grammatician.github.io/post/premise/","tags":["Teleology","Verb-orientated"],"title":"This Blog's Premise"}]
