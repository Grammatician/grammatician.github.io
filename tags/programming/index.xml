      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming in C++ and I am really happy with the language. Function signatures form their own grammar, and I rely heavily on this for calculation
I rely heavely on reading funciton declarations. Having them in header files seperated from their definitions, makes C++ easier to read than C# where you have to wade through the definitions to read the signature.
Without static typing, languages like Python are totally incomprehensible to me.</description>
